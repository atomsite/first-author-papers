# Notes on Paper

## What is this

- This is the first paper written for my postdoctorate at Sheffield, and is an extension of work by Tim Lichtenberg in 2019 for Nature
- Previous work only utilised Al26, and had a limited number of free parameters
- This work represents a wider but shallower parameter space search
  - Two main models are used, core model and grain model, with a third mixed run
