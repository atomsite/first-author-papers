	abstract = {Calculating surface topography in geodynamic models is a common numerical problem. Besides other approaches, the so-called ‘sticky air’ approach has gained interest as a free-surface proxy at the top boundary. The often used free slip condition is thereby vertically extended by introducing a low density, low viscosity fluid layer. This allows the air/crust interface to behave in a similar manner to a true free surface. We present here a theoretical analysis that provides the physical conditions under which the sticky air approach is a valid approximation of a true free surface. Two cases are evaluated that characterize the evolution of topography on different timescales: (1) isostatic relaxation of a cosine perturbation and (2) topography changes above a rising plume. We quantitatively compare topographies calculated by six different numerical codes (using finite difference and finite element techniques) using three different topography calculation methods: (i) direct calculation of topography from normal stress, (ii) body-fitting methods allowing for meshing the topography and (iii) Lagrangian tracking of the topography on an Eulerian grid. It is found that the sticky air approach works well as long as the term (ηst/ηch)/(hst/L)3 is sufficiently small, where ηst and hst are the viscosity and thickness of the sticky air layer, and ηch and L are the characteristic viscosity and length scale of the model, respectively. Spurious lateral fluctuations of topography, as observed in some marker-based sticky air approaches, may effectively be damped by an anisotropic distribution of markers with a higher number of markers per element in the vertical than in the horizontal direction.},

However, the distribution of compositionally Earth-like planets remains insufficiently constrained3, and it is not clear whether the Solar System is a statistical outlier or can be explained by more general planetary formation processes. Here we use numerical models of planet formation, evolution and interior structure to show that a planet's bulk water fraction and radius are anti-correlated with initial 26Al levels in the planetesimal-based accretion framework. The heat generated by this short-lived radionuclide rapidly dehydrates planetesimals8 before their accretion onto larger protoplanets and yields a system-wide correlation9,10 of planetary bulk water abundances, which, for instance, can explain the lack of a clear orbital trend in the water budgets of the TRAPPIST-1 planets11. Qualitatively, our models suggest two main scenarios for the formation of planetary systems: high-26Al systems, like our Solar System, form small, water-depleted planets, whereas those devoid of 26Al predominantly form ocean worlds. For planets of similar mass, the mean planetary transit radii of the ocean planet population can be up to about 10\% larger than for planets from the 26Al-rich formation scenario.},

	abstract = {We have designed a 2D thermal-mechanical code, incorporating both a characteristics based marker-in-cell method and conservative finite-difference (FD) schemes. In this paper we will give a detailed description of this code. The temperature equation is advanced in time with the Lagrangian marker techniques based on the method of characteristics and the temperature solution is interpolated back to an Eulerian grid configuration at each timestep. This marker approach allows for the accurate portrayal of very fine thermal structures. For attaining a high relative accuracy in the solution of the matrix equations associated with both the momentum and temperature equations, we have employed the direct matrix inversion technique, which becomes feasible with the advent of very large shared-memory machines. Our conservative finite-difference schemes allow us to capture sharp variations of the stresses and thermal gradients in problems with a strongly variable viscosity and thermal conductivity. We have tested this code with numerous examples drawn from Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, the descent of a stiff object into a medium with a lower viscosity, viscous heating and flows with non-Netwonian rheology. We have also benchmarked successfully with variable viscosity convection for lateral viscosity contrast up to 10 8. We have delineated the regions in thermal problems where the diffusive nature of the temperature equation changes from its parabolic character locally to a non-linear hyperbolic-like equation due to the presence of variable thermal conductivity. Finally we discuss the applicability of this marker-based and finite-difference technique to other evolutionary equations in geophysics.},

The subsequent thermo-mechanical evolution, such as internal differentiation or rapid volatile degassing, yields important implications for the final structure, composition and evolution of terrestrial planets. SLR-driven heating in the Solar system is sensitive to the absolute abundance and homogeneity of SLRs within the protoplanetary disc present during the condensation of the first solids. In order to explain the diverse compositions found for extrasolar planets, it is important to understand the distribution of SLRs in active planet formation regions (star clusters) during their first few Myr of evolution. By constraining the range of possible effects, we show how the imprint of SLRs can be extrapolated to exoplanetary systems and derive statistical predictions for the distribution of 26Al and 60Fe based on N-body simulations of typical to large clusters (103-104 stars) with a range of initial conditions. We quantify the pollution of protoplanetary discs by supernova ejecta and show that the likelihood of enrichment levels similar to or higher than the Solar system can vary considerably, depending on the cluster morphology. Furthermore, many enriched systems show an excess in radiogenic heating compared to Solar system levels, which implies that the formation and evolution of planetesimals could vary significantly depending on the birth environment of their host stars.},

Due to the complexity of the decay scheme of this radioisotope, previous geophysical studies have used values ranging from 1.2 to 4MeV per decay. The upper bound corresponds to the difference in mass energy between the 26Al and 26Mg ground states. This includes energy carried away by neutrinos, which does not contribute to heating planetary material. The lower bound does not account for the heating caused by the absorption of the γ rays from the excited 26Mg, or for the annihilation energy deposited in the material if the decay occurs inside even small planetesimals. Based on the calculations described by Schramm et al. [Schramm, D., Tera, F., Wasserburg, G.J., 1970. The isotopic abundance of 26Mg and limits on 26Al in the early Solar System. Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 10, 44–59] updated with the most recent nuclear constants, we recommend using a heat production value of 3.12MeV per decay, which is the total energy of disintegration minus the energy carried off by the neutrinos.

To account for significantly smaller radii, masses, gravity and accretion energies early, intense heat sources are required, e.g. the short-lived nuclides {\textless}sup{\textgreater}26{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}Al and {\textless}sup{\textgreater}60{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}Fe.

The common heat conduction equation has been modified to consider also melt segregation. In the initial state, the planetesimals are assumed to be highly porous and consist of a mixture of Fe,Ni-FeS and silicates consistent to an H-chondritic composition. The porosity change due to the so called hot pressing is simulated by solving a corresponding differential equation. Magma segregation of iron and silicate melt is treated according to the flow in porous media theory by using the Darcy flow equation and allowing a maximal melt fraction of 50\%.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We show that the differentiation in planetesimals depends strongly on the formation time, accretion duration, and accretion law and cannot be assumed as instantaneous. Iron melt segregation starts almost simultaneously with silicate segregation and lasts between 0.4 and 10 Ma. The degree of differentiation varies significantly and the most evolved structure consists of an iron core, a silicate mantle, which are covered by an undifferentiated but sintered layer and an undifferentiated and unsintered regolith – suggesting that chondrites and achondrites can originate from the same parent body.},

Among three potential hy-ppv structures analyzed, one was found to be stable at pressures relevant to the lower-mantle D″ region. Hydrogen has a pronounced effect on the elastic properties of post-perovskite due to magnesium defects associated with hydration, including a reduction of the zero-pressure bulk (K0) and shear (G0) moduli by 5\% and 8\%, respectively, for a structure containing ∼1wt.\% H2O. However, with increasing pressure the moduli of hy-ppv increase significantly relative to ppv, resulting in a structure that is only 1\% slower in bulk compressional velocity and 2.5\% slower in shear-wave velocity than ppv at 120GPa. In contrast, the reduction of certain anisotropic elastic constants (Cij) in hy-ppv increases with pressure (notably, C55, C66, and C23), indicating that hydration generally increases elastic anisotropy in hy-ppv at D″ pressures. Calculated infrared absorption spectra show two O–H stretching bands at ∼3500cm−1 that shift with pressure to lower wavenumber by about 2cm−1/GPa. At 120GPa the hydrogen bonds in hy-ppv are still asymmetric. The stability of a hy-ppv structure containing 1–2wt.\% H2O at D″ pressures implies that post-perovskite may be a host for recycled or primordial hydrogen near the Earth’s core-mantle boundary.},

	abstract = {Abstract— The melting of planetesimals heated by 26Al has been modelled using a new finite difference method that incorporates convection. As an example, we consider a planetesimal with a radius of 64 km, which accretes instantaneously at t = 0.75 Myr (after the formation of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions) from cold (250 K) nebular dust with 50\% porosity. At t = 0.9 Myr (T = 700 K), the planetesimal shrinks to a radius of 50 km due to sintering. At t = 1.2 Myr (T= 1425 K), the fully insulated interior, deeper than a few kilometers, starts to melt, and at t = 1.5 Myr (T = 1725 K), with 50\% melting, convection starts. By t = 2 Myr, the planetesimal is a globe of molten, convecting slurry inside a thin residual crust. From about t = 2.5 Myr, the crust thickens rapidly as the power of 26Al fades. Planetesimals probably melt in this manner when they accrete before t = 1.3 Myr and are large enough to insulate themselves (R {\textgreater}20 km for accretion at t = 0, rising to {\textgreater}80 km at t = 1.3 Myr). Melting behavior will also be affected by the level of 60Fe in nebular dust, by the extent of devolatilization reactions and basalt segregation during heating, and by gradual accretion. The model suggests that a) the parent bodies of differentiated meteorites had accreted before about t = 1.5 to 2 Myr and before most chondritic parent bodies had formed, and b) that molten planetesimals may be a source for chondrule melt droplets.},

Excesses of 26Mg observed in refractory inclusions are not the result of mixing of "fossil" interstellar 26Mg with normal solar system Mg. Some material was present that contained little or no 26Al, but it was a minor component of solar system matter in the region where CV3 and CO3 carbonaceous chondrites accreted and probably was a minor component in the accretion regions of CM chondrites as well. Data for other chondrite groups are too scanty to make similar statements. The implied long individual nebular histories of CMs and the apparent gap of one or more million years between the start of CAI formation and the start of chondrule formation require the action of some nebular mechanism that prevented the CAIs from drifting into the Sun. Deciding whether 26Al was or was not the agent of heating that caused melting in the achondrite parent bodies hinges less on its widespread abundance in the nebula than it does on the timing of planetesimal accretion relative to the formation of the CAIs.},

	abstract = {The present size frequency distribution (SFD) of bodies in the asteroid belt appears to have preserved some record of the primordial population, with an excess of bodies of diameter D∼100km relative to a simple power law. The survival of Vesta’s basaltic crust also implies that the early SFD had a shallow slope in the range ∼10–100km. (Morbidelli, A., Bottke, W.F., Nesvorny, D., Levison, H.F. [2009]. Icarus 204, 558–573) were unable to produce these features by accretion from an initial population of km-sized planetesimals. They concluded that bodies with sizes in the range ∼100–1000km and a SFD similar to the current population were produced directly from solid particles of sub-meter scale, without experiencing accretion through intermediate sizes. We present results of new accretion simulations in the primordial asteroid region. The requisite SFD can be produced from an initial population of planetesimals of sizes ≲0.1km, smaller than the usual assumption of km-sized bodies. The bump at D∼100km is produced by a transition from dispersion-dominated runaway growth to a regime dominated by Keplerian shear, before the formation of large protoplanetary embryos. Thus, accretion of the asteroids from an initial population of small (sub-km) planetesimals cannot be ruled out.},

This short-lived nuclide (half-life 7.4×105 yr) is formed by proton bombardment of light elements3 and is of particular interest in theories of nucleosynthesis and heat generation during the early history of the Solar System. Analysed material must have a high Al/Mg ratio to avoid the dilution of any radiogenic 26Mg by common Mg. Consequently, previous workers have chosen mainly feldspars from basaltic achondrites and metamorphosed chondrites. The apparent absence of excess 26Mg in such meteorites is, however, not suprising, because the condensation of chondritic material from the solar nebula now seems4 to predate its later metamorphism by some 80 Myr, and the magmatic activity that produced the basaltic achondrites is younger still. Thus, the feldspars that formed as a result of these processes would incorporate aluminium that was separated from a nucleo-synthetic event by at least 80 Myr and because of its short halflife in-sufficient 26Al would remain to generate a detectable 28Mg anomaly.},

Such variations in thermal history can be more simply explained by the presence of different amounts of the radionuclide aluminum-26, whose decay products are observed in meteorites, in planetesimals. These differences occurred naturally as a function of the increasing amount of time required to accrete objects farther from the sun, during which aluminum-26 decayed from its initial concentration in the solar nebula. Both theory and isotopic evidence suggest that increases in accretion time across the asteroid belt are of order several half-lives of aluminum-26, which is sufficient to produce the inferred differences in thermal history.},

	abstract = {Star and planet formation are inextricably linked. In the earliest phases of the collapse of a protostar, a disc forms around the young star and such discs are observed for the first several million years of a star’s life. It is within these circumstellar, or protoplanetary, discs that the first stages of planet formation occur. Recent observations from the Atacama large millimetre array (ALMA) suggest that planet formation may already be underway after only 1 Myr of a star’s life. However, stars do not form in isolation; they form from the collapse and fragmentation of giant molecular clouds several parsecs in size. This results in young stars forming in groups—often referred to as ‘clusters’. In these star-forming regions, the stellar density is much higher than the location of the Sun and other stars in the Galactic disc that host exoplanets. As such, the environment where stars form has the potential to influence the planet formation process. In star-forming regions, protoplanetary discs can be truncated or destroyed by interactions with passing stars, as well as photoevaporation from the radiation fields of very massive stars. Once formed, the planets themselves can have their orbits altered by dynamical encounters—either directly from passing stars or through secondary effects such as the Kozai–Lidov mechanism. In this contribution, I review the different processes that can affect planet formation and stability in star-forming regions. I discuss each process in light of the typical range of stellar densities observed for star-forming regions. I finish by discussing these effects in the context of theories for the birth environment of the Solar System.},

The explosion has been simulated following three different assumptions in order to show how the yields depend on the remnant mass−initial mass relation. An extended network from H to Bi is fully coupled to the physical evolution of the models. The main results can be summarized as follows. (a) At solar metallicity, the maximum mass exploding as a red supergiant (RSG) is of the order of 17 in the nonrotating case, with the more massive stars exploding as Wolf–Rayet (WR) stars. All rotating models, conversely, explode as WR stars. (b) The interplay between the core He-burning and the H-burning shell, triggered by the rotation-induced instabilities, drives the synthesis of a large primary amount of all the products of CNO, not just . A fraction of them greatly enriches the radiative part of the He core (and is responsible for the large production of F), and a fraction enters the convective core, leading therefore to an important primary neutron flux able to synthesize heavy nuclei up to Pb. (c) In our scenario, remnant masses of the order of those inferred from the first detections of gravitational waves (GW 150914, GW 151226, GW 170104, GW 170814) are predicted at all metallicities for none or moderate initial rotation velocities.},

	abstract = {Iron meteorites provide some of the most direct insights into the processes and timescales of core formation in planetesimals. Of these, group IVB irons stand out by having one of the youngest 182Hf-182W model ages for metal segregation (2.9 ± 0.6 Ma after solar system formation), as well as the lowest bulk sulfur content and hence highest liquidus temperature. Here, using a new model for the internal evolution of the IVB parent body, we show that a single stage of metal-silicate separation cannot account for the complete melting of pure Fe metal at the relatively late time given by the Hf-W model age. Instead, a complex metal-silicate separation scenario is required that includes migration of partial silicate melts, formation of a shallow magma ocean, and core formation in two distinct stages of metal segregation. In the first stage, a protocore formed at ≈1.5 Ma via settling of metal particles in a mantle magma ocean, followed by metal segregation from a shallow magma ocean at ≈5.4 Ma. As these stages of metal segregation occurred at different times, the two metal fractions had different 182W compositions. Consequently, the final 182W composition of the IVB core does not correspond to a single differentiation event, but represents the average composition of early- and late-segregated core fractions. Our best fit model indicates an ≈100 km radius for the IVB parent body and provides an accretion age of ≈0.1–0.5 Ma after solar system formation. The computed solidification time is, furthermore, consistent with the Re-Os age for crystallization of the IVB core.},

	abstract = {The meteorite paleomagnetic record indicates that differentiated (and potentially, partially differentiated) planetesimals generated dynamo fields in the first 5–40 Myr after the formation of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs). This early period of dynamo activity has been attributed to thermal convection in the liquid cores of these planetesimals during an early period of magma ocean convection. To better understand the controls on thermal dynamo generation in planetesimals, we have developed a one dimensional model of the thermal evolution of planetesimals from accretion through to the shutdown of convection in their silicate magma oceans for a variety of accretionary scenarios. The heat source of these bodies is the short-lived radiogenic isotope 26Al. During differentiation, 26Al partitions into the silicate portion of these bodies, causing their magma oceans to heat up and introducing stable thermal stratification to the top of their cores, which inhibits dynamo generation. In “instantaneously” accreting bodies, this effect causes a delay on the order of {\textgreater}10 Myr to whole core convection and dynamo generation while this stratification is eroded. However, gradual core formation in bodies that accrete over {\textgreater}0.1 Myr can minimize the development of this stratification, allowing dynamo generation from ∼4 Myr after CAI formation. Our model also predicts partially differentiated planetesimals with a core and mantle overlain by a chondritic crust for accretion timescales {\textgreater}1.2 Myr, although none of these bodies generate a thermal dynamo field. We compare our results from thousands of model runs to the meteorite paleomagnetic record to constrain the physical properties of their parent bodies.},

	abstract = {Short-lived radioisotopes, in particular 26Al and 60Fe, are thought to contribute to the internal heating of the Earth, but are significantly more abundant in the solar system compared to the interstellar medium. The presence of their decay products in the oldest solar system objects argues for their inclusion in the Sun’s protoplanetary disk almost immediately after the star formation event that formed the Sun. Various scenarios have been proposed for their delivery to the solar system, usually involving one or more core-collapse supernovae of massive stars. An alternative scenario involves the young Sun encountering an evolved asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. AGBs were previously discounted as a viable enrichment scenario for the solar system due to the presumed low probability of an encounter between an old, evolved star and a young pre-main-sequence star. We report the discovery in Gaia data of an interloping AGB star in the star-forming region NGC2264, demonstrating that old, evolved stars can encounter young forming planetary systems. We use simulations to calculate the yields of 26Al and 60Fe from AGBs and their contribution to the long-term geophysical heating of a planet, and find that these are comfortably within the range previously calculated for the solar system.},
